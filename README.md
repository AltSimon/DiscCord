# DiscCord mod #

## About ##
DiscCord is a Minecraft mod that introduces a Custom Record. This Custom Record can have a URL written to it (Youtube, Discord CDN, Dropbox, Google Drive), allowing you to play any song you can think of in a Jukebox.

### Important note!
This mod requires the user to install [**FFmpeg**](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ "FFmpeg builds (Windows) ") and [**YoutubeDL**](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/latest/ "YoutubeDL Repository") into the dedicated folder in **config/disccord/**

There is a config option to install it for you which will grab the required executable from a third party website. (Use with caution)

#### Credits
This mod is A NeoForge version based on the fabric mod [**URL Music Discs**](https://modrinth.com/mod/url-music-discs "URL Music Discs - Modrinth") which was a mod that added the same feature. The original mod has been archived and the Modrinth page it was hosted on states it's no longer maintained.
